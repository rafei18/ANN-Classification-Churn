# End-to-End Deep Learning Project: Customer Churn Prediction

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a complete end-to-end implementation of a deep learning solution for predicting customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The goal is to classify customers based on their likelihood of churning, helping businesses improve customer retention strategies.

The project includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful input features for the ANN model.
- **Model Development**: Building and training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
- **Streamlit Web App**: An interactive web interface for users to input data and predict churn.
- **Deployment**: Hosting the application using Streamlit's sharing platform.

## üìÇ Dataset: Churn Modeling

- **Source**: The dataset used for this project is the **Churn Modeling** dataset.
- **Details**: This dataset contains customer demographics, account details, and churn status.
- **Target Variable**: `Exited` (1 for churn, 0 otherwise).
